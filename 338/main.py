            # Explanation: 
            #   - 'offset' is the largest power of 2 â‰¤ i
            #   - Subtracting 'offset' from 'i' removes the most significant 1-bit
            #   - We add 1 because the removed bit was 1
            dp[i] = 1 + dp[i - offset]
        
        # Return the list containing the count of 1s for each number from 0 to n
        return dp
        
        
# Example usage:
sol = Solution()  # Create an instance of the Solution class
n = 5
print(sol.countBits(n))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2]
